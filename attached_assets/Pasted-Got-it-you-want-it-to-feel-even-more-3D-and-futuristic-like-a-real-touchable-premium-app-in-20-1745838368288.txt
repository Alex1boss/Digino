Got it — you want it to feel even more 3D and futuristic — like a real "touchable" premium app in 2030!

Here’s your updated and highly detailed 3D-focused UI prompt:

Ultra-Detailed 3D Add Product Page Prompt:


---

"Design a full-screen, fully 3D-inspired "Add Product" form for an AI-driven digital product marketplace platform.
The design must feel futuristic, professional, premium, and alive. Focus on clean depth, natural highlights, realistic lighting, and a tactile feeling.

1. Layout and Card:

Full-screen semi-transparent glassmorphism-style container.

Soft frosted glass background effect behind the main form.

Smoothly rounded corners (very modern, not sharp).

Subtle, soft neon glow around the card border (extremely faint).

Card lightly elevated with realistic shadow beneath.


2. 3D Form Fields:

Input fields look slightly sunken into the card (inset shadow effect).

When a user clicks into a field: soft lighting moves, fields lightly pop out (raised slightly).

Tiny depth animation on hover/focus: field glows very subtly.


3. 3D Buttons:

Primary CTA ("Next" / "Submit"): Fully 3D button with a slight bevel, glowing edge.

Hover animation: button gently lifts up and glows more.

Secondary button ("Back"): lighter color, flat but still stylish (ghost button).


4. Lighting & Shadows:

Realistic lighting simulation:

Light source from top-left.

Slight light gradients over the form.

Inputs have soft internal highlights for realism.


Shadows are smooth, low-opacity, and spread naturally.


5. Typography:

Futuristic sans-serif font — slightly rounded, geometric, modern.

Labels are clean and spaced far from inputs for breathing room.

Text glows very lightly or has a gentle outer softness.


6. Colors & Mood:

Background: pure white OR smooth gradient (white to soft light gray).

Inputs: clean light silver with soft inside shadows.

Button: subtle metallic feel (blueish or purplish hues optional).


7. Form Fields (3D Styled):

Product Title (3D text input)

Category (3D dropdown)

Price (3D input with currency prefix)

Short Description (3D textarea)

Seller Name

Seller Profile Image Upload (Button to upload inside 3D circular frame)

Seller Bio

Seller Website

Seller Location (Dropdown)


8. Micro-Animations:

Fields breathe slightly (tiny pulse) when loading.

Button has a micro bounce after submission success.

Uploaded profile image rotates subtly once uploaded.


9. Extra Trust Elements:

Under Seller Name: Verified badge (small shield icon after verification).

Trust badges or "100% secure" under the Submit button.

Option to add "Verified Seller" application after submitting.


10. Overall Vibe:

Feels like a futuristic, interactive holographic dashboard.

Extremely clean, luxurious, and user-first.

Would you like me to now generate a sample 3D UI mockup based on this upgraded 3D prompt?
(If yes, it may take about 1-2 minutes because 3D designs are a little heavier, but the quality will be amazing!)

Should I start?
(Reply fast so I can deliver quickly!)
