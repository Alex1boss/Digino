Billion-Dollar Premium App UI Plan for You:

1. Color Theme (New)

Use a minimal luxury palette like this:

Primary Color: #0A0A23 (Deep Navy Black) — premium tech feel

Accent Color: #4F46E5 (Royal Bluish Purple) — modern AI tone

Background Color: #F9FAFB (Super Soft White) — keeps things clean

Secondary Text Color: #6B7280 (Soft Grey) — for non-important texts

Highlight Color: #22C55E (Fresh Green) — for “Smart Deal” badges, offers


> This combo is widely used in billion-dollar apps like Notion, Revolut, and new-gen AI platforms.

2. Typography (Fonts)

Use only 1 clean font across the app:

Recommended: Inter, Poppins, or Sora
(These are modern, super-readable fonts loved by big startups.)

Heading Font Weight: 600-700 (semi-bold)

Subtext Font Weight: 400-500 (normal)

Button Font Weight: 600 (bold)

3. Screen Layout Improvements

Product Cards Layout:

Rounded corners (radius: 16px)

Shadow effect (very light, premium, soft glow)

"Smart Choice" badge top-left

If there’s a discount, show in fresh green (#22C55E)

Price in bold, secondary info in grey


Example product card design:

Bottom Navigation Bar Layout:

5 icons maximum: Home, Search, Smart Deals, Cart, Profile

Use outline icons — thin and modern (not thick filled ones)

4. Animations

Micro-interactions:

Button tap: Tiny shrink + pop effect

Add to cart: Cart icon shakes slightly

Animations must feel soft and elegant, not cartoonish.
